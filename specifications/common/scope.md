# Scope

Sharing data between autonomous entities requires the provision of metadata to facilitate the transfer of [=Datasets=] by making use of a data transfer (or application layer) protocol. 

This document gives guidance of how this metadata is provisioned:

* This document specifies how [=Datasets=] are advertised via [=Catalogs=] (reusing terminology from [[?vocab-dcat-3]]
* This document specifies how data usage requirements are expressed as [=Policies=] (reusing terminology from [[?odrl-model]] vocabulary).
* This document specifies how [=Agreements=] that govern data usage are syntactically expressed and electronically negotiated during a [=Contract Negotiation=].
* This document specifies how [=Datasets=] are accessed using [=Transfer Process Protocols=].

This document does not apply to the [=Data Transfer Protocol=].

# Introduction

The __Dataspace Protocol__ is used in the context of [=Dataspaces=] as described and defined in the subsequent sections with the purpose to support _interoperability_. In this context, the specification provides fundamental technical interoperability for [=Participants=] in [=Dataspaces=]. Beyond the technical interoperability measures described in this specification, semantic interoperability should be addressed by the [=Participants=]. On the perspective of the [=Dataspace=], interoperability needs to be addressed also on the level of trust, on organizational levels, and on legal levels. The aspect of cross-dataspace communication is not subject of this document, as this is addressed by the [=Dataspaces=]' organizational and legal agreements.

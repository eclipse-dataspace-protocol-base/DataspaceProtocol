        The Dataspace Protocol is a set of specifications designed to facilitate interoperable data sharing between
        entities governed by usage control and based on Web technologies. These specifications define the schemas and
        protocols required for entities to publish data, negotiate Agreements, and access data as part of a federation
        of technical systems termed a Dataspace.

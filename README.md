# Dataspace Protocol

The __Dataspace Protocol__ is a set of specifications designed to facilitate interoperable data sharing between entities governed by usage control and based on Web technologies. These specifications define the schemas and protocols required for entities to publish data, negotiate [Agreements](https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/#dfn-agreement), and access data as part of a federation of technical systems termed a [Dataspace](https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/#dfn-dataspace).

The web rendering of the Dataspace Protocol represents the current state on this repo's main branch: https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/.

## About versions

Previous versions of the Dataspace Protocol ([0.8](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/ids-specification/releases/tag/v0.8) and [2024-1](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/ids-specification/releases/tag/2024-1)) have been developed and released under the governance of the [International Data Spaces Association (IDSA)](https://internationaldataspaces.org/).

Subsequent versions of the Dataspace Protocol are maintained and developed within the [Eclipse Dataspace Protocol project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspace-protocol-base) associated with the [Eclipse Dataspace Working Group](https://dataspace.eclipse.org/), under the governance of the [Eclipse Foundation (EF)](https://www.eclipse.org/). Version [2024-1](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/ids-specification/releases/tag/2024-1) marks the initial contribution to the [Eclipse Dataspace Protocol project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspace-protocol-base) by the IDSA.
